# Imaginative Python
#### This is an overview of topics covered at the Pittsburgh Python users meet-up for November 2019.


Learn to leverage Python towards creative and expressive ends. The goal is to demonstrate ways to incorporate Python into the creative process and expose people with a more traditional technical background to what is possible with computational art.  As of recent more and more multimedia artists are turning toward computational means to make their artistic visions a reality.  As someone who might have an existing knowlege of python or another programming language, getting started should be straight forward to you.  To those without much exposure to computer science, don't fret, it's easier than you think, and getting started with creative projects like these should make learning about important topics much more enjoyable!




# Topics covered at the meet-up:
1. [FoxDot](https://github.com/Qirky/FoxDot) 
* Live coding language implemented in python for creating patterend audio creations (MUSIC!!)
* Leverages SuperCollider synthesis engine.

2. [processing.py](https://py.processing.org/) 
* Full Python implementation of processing.

3. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 
* Can automate complex tasks with python, and create things that would be near impossible without scripting.

4. Writing scripts in python to connect parts of your projects or automate otherwise tedious processes.
* This is easy, and comes in handy in so many situations.
* I use a short python script, that I'll incude in this repo, to covert midi notes to UDP messages to send to various endpoints.  I use this to sync audio with 3d graphics I've made in processing and Unity. I have also used this to sync audio to LEDs and motors on microcontrollers.

# processing.py Resources
* Currently an issue with .py mode working (atleast on mac), you must download the following version of the python mode and unzip into your modes folder.  Make sure you also unzip the src folder. [Correct Version](https://py.processing.org/3/PythonMode_3049.zip)

* [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) Daniel Shiffman has incredible processing tutorials, while many aren't in python they should still be very useful to you!

* [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) Amazing resource for creating GLSL shaders, one way to do this is by wrapping your GLSL code in processing code, to run as a sketch.

# Other tools for creatives (ones that do not use python predominantly) 
#### Many of these you can connect together with a short python script, maybe sending values over OSC or UDP packets to acheive what you desire.
* [Unity](https://unity.com/) (Scripting with C#)
* [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Welcome) (Haskell based live-coding language predominantly used for patterning audio and producing music)
* [Hydra](https://hydra-editor.glitch.me/?) (browser-based GLSL visuals)
* [The Force](https://github.com/shawnlawson/The_Force) (browser-based GLSL visuals)
* [KodeLife](https://hexler.net/products/kodelife) (Stand alone GLSL IDE, Images for Raspberry pi and mobile which is really awesome)
* [MaxMSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max/) (Graphical programming language that has scripting capabilites)
* [PureData](https://puredata.info/) (Offers lua scripting, I beleive there is also a way to script with python with [py/pyext](https://github.com/grrrr/py))
* [PYO](http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/) (Python for digital signal processing)
